OPENMP Assignment1 Scalability

Tested the Sample Images:
System Configuration:-
OS: Linux Ubuntu 20.04 (64 bit)(Installed on Virutal Machine)
Processors: 4
Core(s): 4
RAM: 4 GB

openCV version: 4.5.5

Sample 1: Image dimensions -> 9500 x 6280
Threads = 1: 1.98797 seconds
Threads = 2: 1.23844 seconds
Threads = 3: 1.07903 seconds
Threads = 4: 0.876199 seconds

Sample 2: Image dimensions -> 12000 x 9600
Threads = 1: 3.82202 seconds
Threads = 2: 2.36869 seconds
Threads = 3: 1.91429 seconds
Threads = 4: 1.70132 seconds

Sample 3: Image dimensions -> 10000 x 10000
Threads = 1: 3.97221 seconds
Threads = 2: 2.91572 seconds
Threads = 3: 2.31534 seconds
Threads = 4: 2.13407 seconds


Disussion: It can be seen that with the introduction of openmp parallelism, for 2 threads as also there has been some an improvement in time complexity by around 35-45 percent. It is seen that the Sample Image 1 and Sample Image 3 get brighten up and the Image 2 get little saturated upon histogram equalization.

Note: 1)Program may give certain warning for images which can be ignored
	2)The scability images are also uploaded in the zip file for reference
